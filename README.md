# react-native-wheel-picker

Cross platform Picker component based on React-native.
Since picker is originally supported by ios while Android only supports a ugly Spinner component. If you want to have the same user behaviour, you can use this.
The android component is based on https://github.com/AigeStudio/WheelPicker.
